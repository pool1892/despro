towers 0 i j k = [ ]
towers n i j k = towers (n − 1) i k j ++ [ (i , j ) ] ++ towers (n − 1) k j i

Variante: towersCat, mit:

towersCat t as = towers t ++ as

Betrachte:

1. t = n:
towerCat n i j k as = tower n i j k ++ as
= tower (n-1) i k j ++ [(i,j)] ++ tower (n-1) k j i ++ as
= towerCat (n-1) i k j ((i,j) : towerCat (n-1) k j i as)

2. t = 0:
towersCat 0 i j k as = towers 0 i j k ++ as = [] ++ as = as
